## 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes and optimizes an email marketing campaign for an e-commerce platform using machine learning. The campaign aimed to encourage users to click on a link inside the email. The goal was to:

- Evaluate campaign effectiveness (open rate, click-through rate)
- Identify user engagement patterns
- Build a predictive model to identify users most likely to click the email link
- Recommend data-driven strategies to improve future email targeting

### 🔍 Key Tasks
- Merged three datasets and derived `opened` and `clicked` indicators
- Conducted EDA to find trends by time, country, personalization, and email length
- Engineered features and trained a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Evaluated model using classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Provided actionable insights in a business-friendly PDF report

### 📈 Results
- **Open Rate:** 10.35%
- **Click-Through Rate:** 2.12%
- Personalized & weekday emails performed better
- Higher user past purchases correlated with higher engagement

### 🧠 Impact
This end-to-end machine learning pipeline enables smarter targeting, reduces spammy outreach, and increases click-through rate — demonstrating how data science can directly impact marketing performance.
